###Can you explain me all the order status in a mail please ? and what is triggered ?

I will review the different status and what is triggered and I will create a faq page for admins in the BO so the info is static in one place.

###Why it propose only one slot for today ?

You need to have each diag working exception in mind. 
Anyways, what are the slots time that you would like to have for today if you
search at 15h00. I would like to know so we can tuneup the logic.


###- Sunday is 100% / It should be 740 and not 960 in this example
sometime price for today do not have the right price… it has a weir behavior

I will check the price modifiers in detail

###Other question… How to extract data into an excel (csv) with all orders PAID and DELIVERED for a specific period ? i would like those column : 

Reports and exportation Is out of the scope for now but yes is totally possible.

###Extract csv with orders or possibility to know how much pay to each diag every month was one of the first specification.



###Things to do :
- create an invoice Diagnostical to the one who pay for each order ! (ok for small add, easy to generate a simple pdf from order data)
- Possibility to extract all the orders or get from back office what to pay to each diag every month (MANDATORY)
- Order created : mail notifications to all ADMINS
- Order Prepaid : Notifications to all admins AND diag concerned AND client receive order confirmation by mail
- Payment delegated : The future payer is notified of the payment link / Admin AND DIAG are notified !

When payment is delegated, the PDF is not sent to the Landlord (I remember we alway send the PDF to the landlord mail….. not the agency or company  mail, even if its an agency at the last booking page, they has to fill in Landlord data)

Tell me if you get it, if you have question, or stuff you can to discuss.

I will give you a bonus anyway, its good job


Can you display real name of diag on the « liste diags »
Can you display All the Propriétaire info and not only name. 
Clés / Adresse DOES NOT display, the client selected an address for the key but its not embed in the diag on Diag back office

###Can you add possibility to upload Certification (the Diploma wich display in back office) . I would like to give the possibility to upload several files

    That is already implemented. You need to go to 
    https://blooming-refuge-27843.herokuapp.com/admin#/diag-inscription
    After clicking 'Next', the Diplomes option appear.
    Clicking ADD adds a new row to select a file. Clicking the upload icon will upload the file
    and save the diag again. 
    After the save proccess, you can press the ADD button again to add another file row.

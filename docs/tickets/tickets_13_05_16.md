Man, that is bad news, I asked an investor to check the website… but there is a problem on the Superficie (appartement size) cursor…
Please solve it and tell me when its done
mate, its not working at all at a precious moment.. can you solve it please
Not working at all !!!! apartment size cursor… google place autocompletion…and a bug when i try to go to next step…
please HELPPP

    DONE
    I just create a new url to display an stable branch:

    https://diags-dev.herokuapp.com/#/ (STABLE, no crashs)
    Show this to any investor, or when you need the app working.
    Time to time, if the DEV branch is working ok, I will deploy the code in this branch.
    https://blooming-refuge-27843.herokuapp.com/#/ (DEV, any update will be in here first. May crash.)
    Look at this when you need to see any updates that you are waiting for.
    Both branches are still using the same Dev database.
    I hope it helps

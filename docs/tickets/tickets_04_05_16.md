###Can you explain me all the order status in a mail please ? and what is triggered ?

    I will review the different status and what is triggered 
    and I will create a faq page for admins in the BO so the
    info is static in one place.Its is 
    Settings -> Documentation ( /admin#/documentation )

###Why it propose only one slot for today ?

    You need to have each diag working exception in mind. 
    Anyways, what are the slots time that you would like to 
    have for today if you search at 15h00. 
    I would like to know so we can tuneup the logic.


###- Sunday is 100% / It should be 740 and not 960 in this example
sometime price for today do not have the right price… it has a weir behavior

    I will check the price modifiers in detail. Answer pending.

###Other question… How to extract data into an excel (csv) with all orders PAID and DELIVERED for a specific period ? i would like those column : 

    Reports and exportation Is out of the scope for now but yes is totally possible.

###Extract csv with orders or possibility to know how much pay to each diag every month was one of the first specification.

    It was not in the budget for this second phase (design only) 
    and I was not done in the first project delivery, in which 
    only I will be fixing any issue of the features developed 
    and delivered. I will upload a new price quote adding this feature.

###Things to do :
 - create an invoice Diagnostical to the one who pay for each order ! (ok for small add, easy to generate a simple pdf from order data).
 - Possibility to extract all the orders or get from back office what to pay to each diag every month (MANDATORY)
    
    
    I will upload a new price quote for these features.

####Order created : mail notifications to all ADMINS

    pending (you may need to consider this. Order in status 
    created are not yet paid or delegated. An email     
    notification to all admin is currently happening when 
    the order change to ordered or prepaid).

####Order Prepaid : Notifications to all admins AND diag concerned AND client receive order confirmation by mail

    Its currently done. See events sheet in the boards.

####Payment delegated : The future payer is notified of the payment link / Admin AND DIAG are notified ! 

    Pending.

###When payment is delegated, the PDF is not sent to the Landlord (I remember we alway send the PDF to the landlord mail….. not the agency or company  mail, even if its an agency at the last booking page, they has to fill in Landlord data)

    Validations pending.

When I select a month in monthly report.. I need only the DIAGs that have their status TURN to Delivered and complete within the selected month.
If diag order 25th of february… diag date is 28th of february ..; and delivery date 1 mars…. this diag should appear only on the MARS extraction.
Can you confirm you get it ?
    
    Confirmed. Its Done.
